# Task0
> Runtime complexity = O(1)
## Reason
list index access is constant time operation.
any_list[-x] is the syntatic sugar of any_list[len(any_list) -]

----------------

# Task1
> Runtime complexity = O(n)
## Reason
Solution iterated over the texts and calls and added them to the set of the telephone numbers

----------------

# Task2
> Runtime complexity = O(n)
## Reason
Solution iterated over the calls and identified the telephone number that spent the longest time on the phone
during the period.

----------------

# Task3
> Runtime complexity = O(nlogn)
## Reason
Solution 
1. iterated over the calls and identified the calls made from bangalore - took O(n)
2. sorted the calls made from bangalore - took O(nlogn)
So overall complexity - O(nlogn)

----------------

# Task4
> Runtime complexiy = O(n^2)
## Reason
Solution
1. iterated over the calls and texts identified possible telemarketers and their call pattern - took O(n)
2. iterated over the telemarketers who made call and then looped over the telemarketers who received calls/messages, telemarketers who sent messages - took O(n^2)
3. sorted the identified telemarketers - took O(nlogn)
So overall complexity - O(n^2)
